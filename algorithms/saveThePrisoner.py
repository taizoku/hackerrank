# A jail has a number of prisoners and a number of treats to pass out to them.
# Their jailer decides the fairest way to divide the treats is to seat the prisoners
# around a circular table in sequentially numbered chairs.

# A chair number will be drawn from a hat.
# Beginning with the prisoner in that chair,
# one candy will be handed to each prisoner sequentially around the table until all have been distributed.

# The jailer is playing a little joke, though.
# The last piece of candy looks like all the others, but it tastes awful.
# Determine the chair number occupied by the prisoner who will receive that candy.
